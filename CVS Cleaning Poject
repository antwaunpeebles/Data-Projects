Creating a data cleaning project in Python can be broken down into several key steps. 
This is a simple project where we clean a sample dataset using Pandas and other useful libraries for
handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data, and perform general preprocessing.

Project Objective:
  1.Project Objective: Clean a CSV dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns. Normalize or scale data if necessary.
  2.Dataset: Weâ€™ll simulate a dataset with missing values, incorrect types, duplicates, and unnecessary columns.
