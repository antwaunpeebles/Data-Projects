# Company-Budget-Tracker

Creating a company budget tracker in Python is a great project that involves tracking expenses, income, and budget allocations. The goal is to allow the user to input data, perform necessary calculations, and then output the results into an Excel spreadsheet for further use.

We'll use Pandas for data management and OpenPyXL or XlsxWriter for writing the data to an Excel file.

Steps for the Budget Tracker:
  1. Define Categories: The budget will be divided into categories (e.g., Income, Expenses, and Allocations).
  2. Input Budget Data: We'll create input functions for adding budget data.
  3. Calculate Totals: Calculate the total income, total expenses, and remaining budget.
  4. Save to Excel: Output the budget data into an Excel file.
     
We'll start by simulating data entry and calculation using Python and then save everything to an Excel file.
